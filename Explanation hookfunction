hookfunction â€“ function that intercepts a function and replaces it with a new one ( hookfunction(old, new) )
A simple example:

hookfunction(print, warn)

This script intercepts the print function and replaces it with warn
Here is a second example that intercepts the print function:

hookfunction(print, function(war)
  warn("Sms: " .. war)
end)

For reference: hookfunction completely replaces the function with a new one
